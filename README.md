# Rails vs Real Life

Rails is omakase. Important thing that restaurant owners forgot to include in the menu was a disclaimer:
"The consumption of raw or undercooked meats or eggs can be harmful to your health". We will look at some dishes
that are served raw by Rails and see how dangerous they can be. We will also try to find a way for you to finish
cooking these dishes yourself.

This rails application is created as a sandbox for concurrency-related extra-raw dishes exposure.
